            A factory is an industrial facility where goods are manufactured or assembled systematically using machinery, tools, and labor. It typically operates on a large scale, producing items in significant quantities. Factories are organized to optimize production efficiency and reduce costs through streamlined processes and automation. Workers in factories often perform specialized tasks within the production line, contributing to the overall output.

            Factories can produce a wide range of products, from consumer goods to industrial equipment. Modern factories often incorporate advanced technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance productivity and quality control. They play a crucial role in the economy by generating employment, driving innovation, and contributing to the supply chain. Environmental considerations are increasingly important in factory operations, with a focus on sustainable practices and reducing carbon footprints. Factories are essential to industrial and economic development, supporting both local and global markets.
